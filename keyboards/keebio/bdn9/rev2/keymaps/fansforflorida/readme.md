# BDN9

I have a Keebio BDN9 macropad configured with all my frequently used IDE shortcuts, such as Debug Step Over, Debug Step Out, Run, Terminate, and so on. I use relegendable keycaps to label each key accordingly. Here is how I have my BDN9 configured:

| **Open Type** | **Change Layers** | **Open File** |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| **Toggle Breakpoints** | **Run/Resume** | **End** |
| **Step Over** | **Step Into** | **Step Return** |

I use separate layers for Visual Studio and Eclipse. For example, Debug Step Over is F10 in Visual Studio and F6 in Eclipse. However, I do not need to memorize these, since the bottom left key is always Debug Step Over regardless of the IDE.

Turning the rotary encoder adjusts the RGB brightness, and tapping it changes layers. I customized the firmware to light each layer a different color as a visual indication of the active layer.
