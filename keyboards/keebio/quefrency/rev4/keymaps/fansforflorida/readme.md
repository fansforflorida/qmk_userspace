# Quefrency rev4

My daughter uses a Keebio Quefrency rev4 and kept accidentally hitting the Caps Lock key while typing. (Maybe one day the Quefrency will support a stepped Caps Lock key.)

This uses QMK's [Tap Dance](https://docs.qmk.fm/features/tap_dance) feature to ignore a single tap and send Caps Lock only on double tap.
