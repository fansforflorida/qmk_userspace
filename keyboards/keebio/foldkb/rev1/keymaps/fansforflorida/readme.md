# FoldKB

My FoldKB layout is based on the [Datadesk SmartBoard UPC5000](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/cn4gc8/i_have_been_using_this_datadesk_smartboard/):

* The `=` key is at top left next to 1.
* The Control, Fn, Windows, and Alt keys on the left are in the same positions as the Datadesk SmartBoard.
* The modifier key in the L column is the Windows key; I use this for Windows+L on Windows.

I added some modifications:

* The Caps Lock key is Command for macOS or Ctrl for Windows. This is very comfortable; instead of reaching way down to the corner of the keyboard for Ctrl, just move your pinky over one column from A to Caps Lock. It also maintains muscle memory for physical key combinations; for example, "copy" is always CapsLock+C, regardless of whether you are using Mac or Windows.
* I split the right Shift key, so I have a 1u Fn key on the right half and a 1.25u Fn key on the left half.
* I always use my left hand for modifiers, so the bottom right modifier keys are arrow keys. I originally used Mod-Tap to make those keys dual function. (For example, hold right Shift for Shift, but tap it for up arrow.) However, I never use those keys for modifiers.
* I almost always use my right thumb for spacebar, so the left spacebar is SpaceFN to layer 3.
* The Backspace key is split and is home to backslash/pipe and Del.
* The Backspace key takes the place of backslash/pipe.
* I never use Caps Lock, but I enabled [Caps Word](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_caps_word). (If I really need to use Caps Lock, I access it on layer 2 as Fn+CapsLock.)

Here is a brief summary of my layers:

* Layer 0: Mac layout (Caps Lock is Command).
* Layer 1: Windows layout (Caps Lock is Ctrl). Press Fn+Windows to toggle this layer.
* Layer 2: Numpad and Fn layer (F1-F12 keys, Caps Lock, Ins, etc.). The number pad uses number row keys to avoid NumLock issues in Windows.
* Layer 3: extra navigation keys, since I am used to those keys there on my Nyquist.
