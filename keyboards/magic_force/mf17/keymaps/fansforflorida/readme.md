# MF17

![Magicforce MF17](mf17.jpg)

The Magicforce MF17 is fully supported by both QMK and VIA. It is entirely plastic (including the switch plate), and the case is held together by clips. It has pre-lubed plate-mounted stabilizers, north-facing RGB, silicone plate foam, and a Poron layer under the switches.

It has a single white LED for the Num Lock indicator, which I repurposed as a layer indicator. It is off on layer zero and lights up when any higher layer is active.
